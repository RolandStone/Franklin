Motorcycles are two-wheeled vehicles that are powered by a motor. They usually have handlebars for steering, a seat for the rider, and a frame that supports an engine, drivetrain, and other components necessary for operation. Motorcycles come in many different shapes and sizes, and can be classified in various ways, including standard, cruiser, sport bike, touring, dual-sport, and scooter. Motorcycles are commonly used for transportation, pleasure riding, and competitive racing, and can be found in nearly every country in the world.
