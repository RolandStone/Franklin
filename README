Franklin
A GPTChat backed IRC bot
Franklin runs inside irssi.

!! Setup !!

You should configure franklin.pl to autoload on irssi start, and optionally configure your channel autojoins.
2 Set the API key by running /set franklin_api_key [key goes here] inside irssi.

You'll need to set up a webserver with a directory under it's root called said (usually something like /var/www/html/said/), that is writable by the franklin.pl script.

Create a file called block.lst and fill it, line by line, with any users that abuse the bot.

Edit any variables in franklin you need to from within irssi, such as the domain name of your server where the long-text is hosted, by using /set fraklin_....

Finally, test it by calling with Franklin: say hi! in chat.

!! Debugging !!

... Now test the bot by calling it with "Franklin: print me a test message" in channel (do this from a different nick, not Franklin's nick!)

Sometimes Fraklin fails because of heavy load on the API, connection issues, or the like. It has primitive recovery methods, if it happens to get stuck, just script load franklin.pl again. Should reload Franklin.

!! Settings !!

/set franklin_api_key [apikey]
This is the API key you need to get from OpenAI.

/set franklin_heartbeat_url
A url that the franklin script will hit every 30 seconds to show it has not crashed.

/set franklin_response_webserver_addr

/set franklin_http_location
The directory location of where the files are to be saved to be served by the webserver. Should look like: /var/www/html/said/.

/set franklin_max_retry
